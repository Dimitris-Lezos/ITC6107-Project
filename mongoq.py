"""
Write a Python application in file mongoq.py that answers the following:
1. For a given block serial number, what is its nonce value, digest, and number of transactions contained in the block.
2. Which of the blocks mined so far has the smallest mining time.
3. Which is the average and cumulative mining time of all blocks mined so far.
4. Which block(s) has the largest number of transactions in them.
